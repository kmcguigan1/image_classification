# MNIST Image Classification
This repository aims to implement a convolutional neural network to classify the images in the mnist dataset.

## Motivation
The motivation of this project was to work with tensorflow and a convolutional neural network and to analyze its accuracy in predicting handwritten digits. This work, while simple, looks at some basic architectures one could use in a convolutional neural netowrk based approach to classifying images.
